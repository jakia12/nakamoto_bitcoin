(NASDAQ:KDLY, “KindlyMD”), a leading provider of integrated healthcare services, today announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with Nakamoto Holdings Inc. (“Nakamoto”), a Bitcoin-native holding company, to start a Bitcoin treasury strategy.</p><p> </p><p>Nakamoto is a new holding company founded by David Bailey. In partnership with BTC Inc, Nakamoto seeks to build the first global network of Bitcoin treasury companies.<a href="https://appriver3651013647-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jk_gasthalter_com/Documents/DRAFT_Project%2520Blitz%2520Press%2520Release_5.9.25.docx#_msocom_1"> </a>This is the first step in Nakamoto’s vision for an ecosystem of Bitcoin-native companies, including media, advisory, and financial services, that exist to accelerate Bitcoin adoption and utility.</p><p>‍</p><p>The combined company will aim both to accumulate Bitcoin and grow the Bitcoin owned on a per share basis, or Bitcoin Yield, through a variety of equity, debt and other offerings. This merger gives the public market exposure to Bitcoin within a compliant, transparent structure backed by a uniquely experienced Bitcoin management team, including a partnership with one of the world’s most influential Bitcoin marketing platforms.</p><p>‍</p><p>The PIPE financing attracted participation from over 200 investors across six continents, including global investment firms and leaders across the Bitcoin ecosystem. Institutional investors include Actai Ventures, Arrington Capital, BSQ Capital Partners, Kingsway, Off the Chain Capital, ParaFi, RK Capital, Van Eck, and Yorkville Advisors, alongside individuals including Adam Back, Balaji Srinivasan, Danny Yang, Eric Semler (CEO of Semler Scientific), Jihan Wu, Ricardo Salinas, and Simon Gerovich (CEO of Metaplanet). YA II PN, Ltd., an investment fund managed by Yorkville Advisors, was the sole convertible note purchaser.</p><p>‍</p><p> </p><p>“Traditional finance and Bitcoin-native markets are converging. The securitization of Bitcoin will redraw the world’s economic map. We believe a future is coming where every balance sheet – public or private – holds Bitcoin. Nakamoto seeks to be the first publicly traded conglomerate designed to accelerate that,” said David Bailey, Founder and CEO of Nakamoto. “Nakamoto’s vision is to bring Bitcoin to the center of global capital markets, packaging it into equity, debt, preferred shares, and new hybrid structures that every investor can understand and own. Our mission is simple: list these instruments on every major exchange in the world.”</p><p>‍</p><p>He continued, “Nakamoto is building the first publicly traded conglomerate designed to accelerate that future. The financial institutions who defined their chapter in history have all carried the names of their founders: Medici, Rothschild, Morgan, Goldman. Today, we stake that legacy on Nakamoto.”</p><p>‍</p><p>“This merger represents a strategic leap for KindlyMD, allowing us to expand our mission. Nakamoto brings in a team with deep expertise in Bitcoin strategy and unparalleled access to the leading experts in Bitcoin treasury management,” said Tim Pickett, CEO of KindlyMD. “It&#x27;s a bold new vision that will drive long-term value for our shareholders.”</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Exceptional Management Team and Industry Leading Board of Proposed Combined Company</strong></p><p>‍</p><p> </p><p>Upon the close of the transaction, the combined company will be led by Founder and CEO David Bailey, a leader within the Bitcoin ecosystem and an influential advocate for hyperbitcoinization, the inflection point at which Bitcoin becomes the default value system of the world. As Co-Founder and CEO of BTC Inc – the company behind Bitcoin Magazine and the global annual Bitcoin Conferences – and General Partner of Bitcoin-focused investment firm UTXO Management, Mr. Bailey has built industry-leading platforms at the heart of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Mr. Bailey will be supported by a seasoned management team with decades of experience operating in the Bitcoin space.</p><p>‍</p><p>Tim Pickett, CEO and founder of KindlyMD, will continue to manage KindlyMD’s healthcare operations. Under the combined company, KindlyMD clinics will remain dedicated to their mission of combating the opioid crisis through innovative, holistic health services. The clinics are expected to continue operation with the same care teams and patient-first values that have defined their development to date.</p><p>‍</p><p>The Board of Directors of the combined company will consist of six directors appointed by Nakamoto and one director appointed by KindlyMD, each of whom will be named prior to closing.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Transaction Summary</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>Shares of KindlyMD will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “KDLY.” The combined company expects to be renamed and trade under a new ticker symbol.</p><p>‍</p><p>The Board of Directors of Nakamoto and KindlyMD have unanimously approved the transaction. The transaction will require the approval of the shareholders of KindlyMD and is subject to customary closing conditions.</p><p>‍</p><p>The transaction includes $510 million in gross proceeds from a fully committed private placement in public equity (“PIPE Financing”) priced at $1.12 per share and consisting of common stock and pre-funded warrants in KindlyMD and $200 million in gross proceeds from the sale of senior secured convertible notes of KindlyMD that mature in 2028 (the “Debt Financing”). The PIPE and Debt Financings are expected to close concurrently with the merger.</p><p>‍</p><p>As part of the merger, the combined company will assume the rights and obligations of Nakamoto under its marketing services agreement with BTC Inc, whereby BTC Inc provides certain marketing services to Nakamoto and, following the closing of the merger, will provide such services to the combined company in connection with its Bitcoin treasury and related operations. </p><p>‍</p><p>Additional information about the merger, the PIPE Financing and the Debt Financing will be available in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and at <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http://www.sec.gov&amp;esheet=54242404&amp;newsitemid=20250423962305&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;index=1&amp;md5=ead750329a2487efb2dd688809b5b0f7">www.sec.gov</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Advisors</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>Cohen &amp; Company Capital Markets (“CCM”), a division of J.V.B.

These include the risk that KindlyMD and Nakamoto businesses (which may include the businesses of BTC Inc and/or UTXO in the future, as applicable) will not be integrated successfully and the risk that KindlyMD or the applicable governing bodies of BTC Inc and/or UTXO may not pursue or approve the terms of an acquisition of BTC Inc and/or UTXO; the risk that cost savings, synergies and growth from the proposed transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the possibility that shareholders of KindlyMD may not approve the issuance of new shares of KindlyMD common stock in the Transactions or that shareholders of KindlyMD may not approve the Transactions; the risk that a condition to closing of the Transactions may not be satisfied, that either party may terminate the merger agreement, the subscription agreements of the convertible debt purchase agreement or that the closing of the Transactions might be delayed or not occur at all; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement or completion of the Transactions; the parties do not receive regulatory approval of the Transactions; the occurrence of any other event, change, or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement relating to the Transactions; the risk that changes in KindlyMD’s capital structure and governance could have adverse effects on the market value of its securities; the ability of KindlyMD and Nakamoto to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers and customers and on KindlyMD and Nakamoto’s operating results and business generally; the risk the Transactions could distract management from ongoing business operations or cause KindlyMD and/or Nakamoto to incur substantial costs; the risk that KindlyMD may be unable to reduce expenses or access financing or liquidity; the impact of any related economic downturn; the risk of changes in governmental regulations or enforcement practices; and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. All such factors are difficult to predict and are beyond KindlyMD’s and Nakamoto’s control, including those detailed in KindlyMD’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10- Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and such other documents of KindlyMD filed, or to be filed, with the SEC that are or will be available on KindlyMD’s website at www.kindlymd.com and on the website of the SEC at www.sec.gov. All forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that KindlyMD and Nakamoto believe to be reasonable but that may not prove to be accurate. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and neither KindlyMD or Nakamoto undertakes any obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
